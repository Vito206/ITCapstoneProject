🛡️ Securing Twitch: A CISSP-Based Cybersecurity Capstone
This is a cybersecurity capstone project focused on Twitch, the popular live-streaming platform. Using the CISSP (Certified Information Systems Security Professional) framework, our team developed a set of professional-grade security solutions to address real-world threats such as DDoS attacks, AI moderation risks, data breaches, and account takeovers.

📌 Project Overview
Twitch handles millions of daily users, streamers, and real-time interactions — making it a high-profile target for cyber threats. Our goal was to apply CISSP’s domains to assess, secure, and strengthen Twitch’s infrastructure and policies.

🔧 Final Deliverables
1. 🕹️ Security Architecture Diagram
A custom-built 2D video game–style architecture showing Twitch’s security layers from user access to incident response. Includes WAFs, IAM systems, AutoMod AI, and backend protections.

2. 🔐 Identity & Access Management (IAM) Model
A role-based access control model defining permissions, MFA requirements, and restrictions for streamers, moderators, admins, and bots.

3. 🚨 Incident Response Plan
A Twitch-specific response framework for real-time threats including DDoS attacks, account hijackings, and AutoMod errors. Includes roles, phases, and recovery playbook.

4. 📘 End-User Security Guide
A streamer- and viewer-facing guide with tips on enabling 2FA, spotting scams, managing AutoMod flags, and securing stream keys — designed for accessibility and education.
